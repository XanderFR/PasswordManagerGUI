# PasswordManagerGUI
A simple password manager GUI app written in Python. The program lets the user enter a website, their email address, and a password and the program stores that information in a JSON file. The program can even save changed passwords for a given website. The program also allows the user to search for the email address and password for a given website so long as the information is already in the JSON file. The program can also generate a password with randomized characters.
